### Here is a simple blog page

{" "}

<Image
  src="/images/blog/moon-river.jpg"
  width={800}
  height={10}
  className={"rounded-md"}
  responsive
  sizes="100vw"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={"/images/blog/moon-river.jpg"}
/>

- why its not full?
- is it possible to make a component that shows images responsive and full?
