There is so much things happening, so much information that I can get lost so easily.
The amount of information is porportionate to amount of distraction and procastination.
There should be an extention for my text to be validated with.
There are so many concepts and ideas that one can easily loose focus if he has not a step by step plan to learn.
Ofcourse with the amount of information availavle, it is not possible to learn everything.
human brain has a limited capacity to learn and limited capacity to store new information.

There is no such thing as a save button for the memory to easily save what is outside of the learners brain.
Everyone learn in diffrent pace, some learn better practical and some theorical, but that does not make them any better than each other.
It is not about not knowing what to learn about. is is a lack of ability to prioratise what to do first.
The lack of prioratisation in learning leads us into wanting to learn all at once adn since that is not possible we give up on all we get distracted and procastinate.

## why do we procastinate?

It's all about not having a learning plan. An orgonised thought patern would lead us into discussions with ourself that are not productive and are only talktive.  
We can easily get into habit of procastinating if we are unsure about usefulness of the task that we need to get done.
Procastination is indecisiveness. the inability to decide witch task should be done first and in what order.
To achive a goal there must be set micro-goals that help us to visualise a path towards success.  
We must be able to see that the task at hand is getting us closer to our worthy goal, this goal should be prominent and visual to us.
We must know every nook and cranny of what we want to achive. we must have our vision and our goals visualised.

I just got into adjusting my blog because know my blog is coupuled with the code.
I have more access to the content of the blog while coding and access to the code while blogging.
I now have a page dedicated to my questions, any question that pops in my head and I think its good and worthy I write it there.
In time I'm plannning to go and answer those in their own individual page as a log.
I need to research about those questions, learn, experiment and share my learnings with others who seek such knowledge.

I am not afraid of critisism or being told not in a right position to talk about things.
We are filled with opinions and we have answer for everything, we try to rationalise our behavour and we try to come us with answers that best suite us.  
Our answers can become what we want the answers to be rather than what they really are.
It is the fear that maybe our answer contain something that can be used againsst ourself, maybe its something that is not consistant with what we have been saying all along?
Well these stupid fears leads us to not really answering anything and only coming up with compliments for ourself.  
That is why a good question is much more valuable than an answer to it.

> A good question is much more valuable than an answer to it.

The question is always about the truth but the answer can be far removed from it.  
A question can multiple answers but and answer can't have multipple questions.
A good answer therefore comes from a good question that has arised from a diffrent perspective or from curicity.

I dont know howmany pages I have wrote and I dont care much. I will be writing untill somethig new pops out of my head.
Like a good question that needs to be answered.
