### Description: What is it?

Team up with other creators, Photographers, Models , designers, Editors and writers to collaborate and create digital content.
Joinx is a marketplace for projects that other creators can join in and create together.
Find other creators, create or Join interesting Projects, create and build together.
A platform for creative work.

### Problem: What problem is this solving?

It is hard to find and collaborate with other creators like models, photographers or editors,etc. To create content online.

### Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?

I'm a photographer and video editor. I have ideas for films or creative photography. I would need a writer and models to work with me on this project, but it's hard to find anyone on social media anymore, or find people who are in my area.

### Success: How do we know if weâ€™ve solved this problem?

When creators can match with each other, talk about the project they want to work on, set roles and tasks, and date to start working on it.

### Audience: Who are we building for?

For creators, like photographers -> models -> makeup -> editors

### What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?

It will look like a platform where I can post my project with its details, then I can set who I'm looking for, maybe I'm looking for a model or a video editor. Anyone who is a model or video editor in my city can see my project details and request to join the team. After joining the dashboard will help to manage the tasks.

### How: What is the experiment plan?

I want to learn if this is a real problem by talking to creators and inviting them to try the app and also invite other models or creators.

### When: When does it ship and what are the milestones?

It will ship when the MVP is ready .
First milestone is a form that lets creators sign up - put their details and their skills. To be able to create their profile (the profile can also work as a link in bio with all their works and content and projects they have been involved with)
