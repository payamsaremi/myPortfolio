# Meally

new doesnt mean anything.
It's a big deal, dealing like that.
Im going after all industries.
If I want to stay fresh, and get out of the matrix.
what the fuck am I saying?
should I tell you sometthing?
Its really how you look at it.
It's not that bad.
you will feel amazin.
You can even start our own thing.
but dont you get it?
Im writing for no reason.
So chill out if life ccant et what yyoouou want riht now.
you can get juices flowing efore you make a wine.
You must be clear about its taste.
I am no here to judge you.
I am here to show you an oppotunity.
I am here to let you know that you dont know.
and its better to keep it like that.
the shit is not writing.
