Witme believes that future of healthcare is entangled with AI assistance and lifestyle intervention. chronic prevention is at the heart of the solution for healthcare, our busy lives have driven our mental and physical being into risk of chronic disease. It is not a secret that most of chronic disease are preventable and are caused mostly by our risk behaviors and unhealthy habits. Our healthcare system have not been able to reduce these disease yet. most people are unaware of their unhealthy habits and that has led to increase in these common and costly long-term health problems. Our aging population and changes in societal behavior are contributing to this steady increase.
Witme believes that we can help people become aware of their unhealthy habits and give them the power and motivation to transform all aspects of their life.
