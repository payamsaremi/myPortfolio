Personalised healthy plans that are designed to turn unhealthy behaviours into healthy habits that last a lifetime.

the future of healthcare is entangled with AI assistance and lifestyle intervention and chronic prevention is at the heart of the solution for healthcare, our busy lives have driven our mental and physical being into risk of chronic disease, it is not a secret that most of chronic disease are preventable and are caused mostly by our risk behaviors and unhealthy habits however, our healthcare systems have not been able to reduce these disease, most people are unaware of their unhealthy habits and that has led to increase in these common and costly long-term health problems, our ageing population and changes in societal behaviour are contributing to this steady increase, at witme.co we believe that we can help people become aware of their unhealthy habits and give them the power and motivation to transform all aspects of their life.
