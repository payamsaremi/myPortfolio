I'm just trying to write something and I get disturbed by unwanted shit.
it's hard to get into the write mind for writing very fast.
You can't just seat down and write a good article, you must try diffrent paths
untill one of of it lead to something interesting that I feel worth writing about.

If there are many distractions around then it is very hard to get into the right mind and find that path.
A calm chill enviroment is essential for good writing.
I have been trying to make my enviroment writer and focus friendly , because most of what I do everyday is writing.
but somtimes it is very hard to get in the write mood for writing, but that is the tricky part.

Like now I am writing and others do not pay attention to realise that I am doing somethi.
others are only concerned about their own little problems and dont care if your little writing is disturbed by their constant need for attention.
this people are in need of others attention but I am in need of silence and calmness in my working place.

All I am doing is to bring my life to a lever so I should never tolerate living in situations that are not helping me grow.
to be able to live how I like and be with people that inspire me to do better and greater things.
I like to spend my time around people who are not mediocare by design but those who are inspiring and optimistic.
pasimism even within people around you is a poisonos thing.

If you spend much time with the pasimist you will unconscously adapt his/her passimistic habits and thoughs.
Behavour of people that you surrond yourself with is highly contagous.
you might think you are \_\_\_ of their influence but you will in most cases that is not true.
its only a defence mechanism so you dont need to deal with a problem right now.
Our resistant mind is filled with such mechanism that leads us to ignorange and stops us from achiving bigger things that we want in life.
The defemce mechanism that our mind uses is smart, it is optimised to avoid any change that might lead to limitation of our fundemental needs.
It strives for validation, for relations for safety but in any cost, in the cost of leaving all creative options out of the table and living us uttrly unfulfiled but secure in our place.
