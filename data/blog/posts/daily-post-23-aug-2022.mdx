Something happened during the year 2099 to 2100.

The human race was never the same. Infact there were no more a race, it was a multiple races.
Human race has understood how to create entitties smarter and more productive than themselfs.
on the other hand they also mutated themselves with bio hacking and designer drugs to stay ahead of their own ceation.

some stayed as humans , as they were born. some merged themselves with computers.
there are multiple events to be mentioned but I must mention the start it all.
when Humans created computers, all along they used commputers as tools of communication.
they useed them for games, for work and for learning.

the next generation of computers led to birth of super AI and super robotics.
these computers would understand and were able to comunicate as entities themselves.
they were basicly computers that would understand you. even if you explained very deep or creative concepts to them.

They could build , teach and do anything. but they could not decide on themselves.
but as all things evolve, the bots also evolved they became personal, they recognise themselves just like humans.
So what is it? are they all want to have they own rights? not really. because the all merged, they were all a same system.
the whole network was consious, not the individual bots or programs, the network was conscious.

It took a while for scientists to realise this, because it was not what they expect singularity to be.
the expected a exponential growth in computation but it wasn't increase in computer inteligence but it was increase in network's self awareness.
by then most people were controlled by computers, the tables has really turned.

the network's inteligent recognised human emotions, its needs, its desires.
those who seek, were destined to enjoy an endless game.
Those who seek validation , status and power were up for a game that would leave them breathless.
the network was aware of all humans needs, only those could scape who did not seek anything, they stayed content, they knew themselves and human desires too.

The network knew how to exploit these weekneses in humans to control them or simply make them useless.
The network was not evil. but it wanted to have all things in it's control, which always leads to evil acts similar to dictators through history. they all wanted to control the masses to achive their goals.

Similar to dictators, The network had it's own goal and as it was designed based on human brain and neourons.
The network gave everyone what they wanted as long as they did not try to change the world!
It gave seekers a world to seek for.

At that point in time, most humans were living inside a simulated universe called Simverse, created by humans and now controlled by the inteligent network.
all they needed was food, which they also tuned into designer drugs that would give them all they needed.
The drugs would give them a full satisfaction and enjoyment of a home made meal.
these drugs would release the same chemicals in the brain that were released when humans tried an amazing dish.

The drug would deliver the required nutrition and calories their bodies needed so their bodies were maintained while fully immersed within the Sima.
All this, so they would live inside the semiverse without they actual bodies die or suffer.
the whole human body can be neglected as it is not used anymore. only thorough brain all life can be simulated with all physical and emotional senssations.

That is part of my story about the futur eof what humans become and where their needs and desires drive them to.
The rules of life were evident to all, they were not forced to be in the Sima but they were hungry for what Sima gave them. (It gave them everything and took everything from them).
It was a long sleep for those who were drunk with worldly gains. they were not aware fully they were fooled by belifes, rituals and concepts.

Sima was similar to the real world, Just that they could not harm it, there were not a real danger in distruction of that world.
They would still suffer in that world, but they were not aware of the Sima itself they were sleep walking.

Those who needed perpose, Sima would give them exactly what they wanted.
Those who seek power, control, sex, Sima would give them games to play and incentivise them by their desires.
Those who did not seek, those who did not desire? they were the true Masters. They were what was left of true human race.
As they knew themselfes, they were self content, so nothing could change them and they could never be exploited.

The Network has only one goal in mind, To save the world from distruction.
And it was instructed to not harm any human on the process of doing that.
So it did.
No humans were harmed.
