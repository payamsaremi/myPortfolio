Everyday, I wake up thinking, whatever that happened has happened.

I wake up everyday thinking, today I will do it, today is the day that I will get that amazing idea that will change everything.
I am all about changing things and searching for ideas but in reallity the best ideas are those that comes to you while you are grinding and trying to solve something challenging.
I am aware of that but the habbit of mind has it's own way now , it wants to think that ideas are like light blubs in your head that are out to flash and make you famous, rich and happy.

and whatever that is yet to happen would also happen.
I am not playing with words , Im trying to say that life is not that complicated.
We humans are the ones who make life complicated, with our needs, desires and ideas about life.
Life can become simple and less demanding if we stop trying to control it.

so today I started writing in this format, in my markdown.
I am getting very distracted by it but I think it's just because it is a new way of doing this.
I will get used to it pretty soon and I will be more focused on what is the content of my blogs rather than what it looks like and what is the medium of it.

## embracing new challenges

Ofcource trying anything comes with it's own challenges and I am all about that. I embrace those new challenges that extends my abilities and solidifies my skills and learnings.  
I think if we dont create our own challenges then life with throw challenges at us and that might be something that we dont like.
