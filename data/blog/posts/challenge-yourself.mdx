well, you migt tink that the sound of my keyboard is annying.
But wat is annoying? if I give it a time, what is fear?
What can i take from them? what has become my behaviur.
the behaviur arises from.
What can i say? aout myself?
How can i dream about poems.
That has never been writen
How can I create what has been creating me.
The new is not old.

Its giving me dopemine, I am on the verge.

Things I need

1. to know when to use my mind.
2. database for crypto
3. access your hard drive from any device.
4. a create DAO button. (3Dao)

xme

its good to stay honest.
do wat you want but also accept consequences.
do not lie.
do not miss judge
only accept audiable words.
only find proof.

Everyday, I wake up thinking, whatever that happened has happened.

I wake up everyday thinking, today I will do it, today is the day that I will get that amazing idea that will change everything.
I am all about changing things and searching for ideas but in reallity the best ideas are those that comes to you while you are grinding and trying to solve something challenging.
I am aware of that but the habbit of mind has it's own way now , it wants to think that ideas are like light blubs in your head that are out to flash and make you famous, rich and happy.

and whatever that is yet to happen would also happen.
I am not playing with words , Im trying to say that life is not that complicated.
We humans are the ones who make life complicated, with our needs, desires and ideas about life.
Life can become simple and less demanding if we stop trying to control it.

so today I started writing in this format, in my markdown.
I am getting very distracted by it but I think it's just because it is a new way of doing this.
I will get used to it pretty soon and I will be more focused on what is the content of my blogs rather than what it looks like and what is the medium of it.

## embracing new challenges

Ofcource trying anything comes with it's own challenges and I am all about that. I embrace those new challenges that extends my abilities and solidifies my skills and learnings.  
I think if we dont create our own challenges then life with throw challenges at us and that might be something that we dont like.
