We are all humanity, before our nationality, our government, our beliefs, our income, and our language divide us.
We are all humanity at our core.
The purpose of humanity is to unite and create.
Our gift is creativity.
Everyone is made from that god particle.
We know this, but we have forgotten it.
We choose to get busy with a materialistic world, with titles and social ranks.
Our minds have been trained for self-centrism and egoism, because that is what is thought to be needed for us to be successful and better than others.

When we become divided, we must put all of our efforts into becoming better.
Society has programmed us to desire money, fame, and struggle.
We have been programmed to put all of our efforts into becoming better at school, university, and climbing the ladder at our company and organization.
This is how we have been programmed to want something more than what we are.
This has created a constant urge to become someone else.

I can never be happy with myself if my life's purpose is to become someone else, to be what my parents or my boss expects me to be.
This enormously limits creativity and innovation.
I have given up myself to the expectations of others, I have sold myself for acceptance, and I am stuck with myself because I fear that the self-image I have created of myself will be destroyed by failure or I will disappear from my community that I feel I need to be a part of.
I have forgotten my dreams at the expense of someone else's expectations of me.
I have created someone who is not me.
