# I was visiting my parents back in Iran when the pandemic started.

I was learning Python and backend development  to train ML models on the server. I wanted to start a new project, to build something people wanted. to solidify my learnings.Many tech savvy people can start an online business and start selling their products but most other traditional sellers like my dad ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Q98oA_E_Q-uXMhLp66XnUVHpFtL7CTMgjU25XX7On2YLwQ8EQxs3aQR3DCbT3cR1s1WiIt6t9QXa1sTZSAXLF_X3uATTQB_smWDkoG93zqHkT55e2J_YFl7mYVYAVkVundjUM39BYlUImi5JYctfbk8)are not tech savvy and it is a frustrating task for them to set up an online store by themselves. **So I decided to build an online store for my dad.**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kfey3cf8bD-IcbhO57xZRbeD3sdXOdTwkDuijf62uWtpLMqdKJUKx9UUEwfF0qCFlZDKwDfEfh1Wfb_vohk3bSqHWfe_AJB2F64guPV4_SZw9UufTgr0PHXYE6yHSQe147KzLGZsVToM9vc2Udr4TzY)![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xnyqysO2o153jKATE8KmnqY991PNUkFSyafClWu_ANyqbdl-jM1W2-D-8_9D6bn6FaqIP8Df-jpb12HyCnHgCXewr5x6BSoWssd2ZrxR9eYCZMr1ZhaMNvqkmOkJz3w7J0MyjsEk7H5YxJboJBCfJVc) I used my backend and frontend developing skills to build him a simple online store. The goal was to design something intuitive and simple so he could create an online store by himself on his phone and start getting orders and be able to accept payments.I initially developed the app for my dad but it turned out that many others also needed this simple solution. most common solutions like a wordpress website were just too complicated for them.My proud moment was, when I realized that I have built something that people want!
