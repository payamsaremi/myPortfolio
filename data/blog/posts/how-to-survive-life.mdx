Writing is what most people consider an art, a real creation, a real medium of transferring ideas.
It is writing that spreads science and all religions in the world.
Writing plus publishing through paper made religions into huge organizations.
Therefore, the power of writing is its spreadity. Writing can become viral through the internet.
The Internet has the power to make some content viral and important.
Therefore through a lifetime of creation there will be times when one’s ideas would spread and become well known and that is the power of consistency of work.

Writing daily or weekly overtime would only benefit the writer as it creates more recognition and brings about clarity of mind.
To write about what one does in the current time is also a great way to keep a diary of what one has been thinking and working about in a particular time of life.

Writing also is a way to exercise the mind about the ideas that we have and things that we inspire to do. For example , I understand something a lot better if I write about it rather than constantly worry about or daydream about it.

It has become a habit to write. Daily writing puts things in perspective.
From experience, whenever I wake up and write about the things that I want to do that day, I consciously or unconsciously dream about doing these tasks, I simply create a simulation of the world in my mind and I do these things. I do them better because I am clearly writing about doing them and explaining why I do it and how I should go about doing them.

It makes life so much easier and more productive. Imagination with writing has great powers.
I have imagined living in America with my family and parents and being able to buy things that I could not even imagine before. I wrote it down and I know I'm going to achieve this dream.

I have lived in America and I have made it there. I have built amazing products and companies that I am proud of. Products that have helped millions of people around the world, and companies that are so much bigger than what I could ever imagine.

## What Life Wants?

It has always been human’s imagination that led him to evolve and become better at things.
It has been human’s imagination that brought him from caves to the meadow.
Everything we do in our life we imagine doing it first we run it in the simulation and then we do it in reality.

So this imagination plus writing and ideation can have powerful results.
It is not simply writing but it is a meditation. It is training our mind and focus to become more attentive and simply recognise opportunities that relate to our dreams and aspirations better and faster.

When we are clear about our dreams and our goals, we become clear minded. Life becomes clear. When we know who we are our mind becomes orderly. We tab into the cosmic order.
When we know our dreams , our goals and we simplify our life towards achieving those dreams we become simple and narrow. We find a sense of direction. We would understand where we were going. So going towards that god would become a natural thing. Whenever we encounter something that is getting us to our dreams we unconsciously become attracted to it.

Simplify your life and work towards your biggest dreams, be sure that you can achieve them.
There must be faith and trust in how life operates. We can’t know everything, we only know what we want and how we want it. If we are familiar with our self our mistakes failures about our ideas and dreams, if we recognise our abilities and posibilities we would never loose faith in life.
We would never loose faith in each other. Life is filled with opportunities if we pay attention.
Its only wih attention and a clear mind that we can grab these opportunities by the neck.
To simplify life and wait for these opportunities to appear in life , to be ready for them. Not to seek and idea but to prepare yourself for that idea. To be prepared when the idea the opportunity the inspiration reveals itself you will grab it by its neck and never let go.
Like a hungry lion who stays hungry for months not running around animals only so simply waits for the opportunity to present itself and when it does it uses all his energy to grab it and that is how it will survive.
