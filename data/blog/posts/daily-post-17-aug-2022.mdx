I Just woke up thinking what youd I do. How should I spend my time so in the long run I can achive sucesss, financialy and emotionaly.
What should I work on that will lead me to a better and more consistant situation in life.
I guess these are most common thoughs amoung people, we are always worried and anxies about future.
We are seeking something that can end all of our problems. That's why money has so much value in society.

We are activly searching to solve problems because we use money to solve our problems.
and now if you can provide a soloution to some of our problems , needs and get me closer to what I want in life then you get that cash.
this is society in a nutshell , it is a almos recursive process. to provide something of value and recieve money from it.
but what money is ? money is a transaction. money helps us to measure the value of something. so we can simply transfer value between us.

Before fiat currency money was the direct exchange of goods and services that we had, it was the bartel economy.
today we use fiat currencies backed by goverments and countries, this is our current mean of exchange and in future it might evolve and change.
in retrospective, the innovation in fiat currencies has been in the speed of transaction, durablity and ease of carrying.
I might not be great in the words but I try to choose the words that are understandable and easily transfer my ideas.
language is also a product of society that similar to currencies is made for transfer of knowledge and ideas.
we as humans are social animals that like to share, like to exchange and love to get validated.
our whole societal hierachy is based on these basic human needs. the need to be validated by others, the need to share and spread our ideas, and the need to solve our problems.
So I wake up everyday and think what should I do to improve my life? what poject should I do? what app should I build?
it is the problem of deciding on what to focus that leads me into these questions.

I really want to make something and build something great however, Im always in doubt about what to do and what to start.
so in the meanwhile when we are not sure about what is the porpuse of our life we seek that within books and papers written by men no diffrent than us.
we look into others who seem to figure it all out. we read about them and we praise them. but now we are still not sure who we are.
I am still searching and the seach never ends. the presuure that we must do the right thing and we must choose the right path us to indecisiveness.
We have become animals of a herd. our herd mentality has led us to become slaves to the new world , slaves to social validation.
but what we seek is an idea and reality is about not seeking ideas but being who we are. to stay in our own solitude.

What does it mean to stop the search? what does it mean to not seek anymore? does that mean to give up on all of our dreams?
does it mean to not do anything and not to build cool things? certainly not. if we stop the search, if we stop the constant need for validation,
we will become a better builders, a better creators. the creator seeks creativity not societies validation of what he does or make.
the creator build for the sake of building not for profit or not for looking great in the eyes of others.
the creator embraces the act of creation, the process of creation , the creativity itself.
Once we loose the need for constant validation we become who we are rather than becoming what society wants us to be.
we react as our own totality and remove all that is not us. the idea of ourself will parish as we recognise our true self

> The creator embraces the act of creation, the process of creation , the creativity itself.

I am happy and grateful that I have multiple sources of income and I am turnong my ideas into products that people love to use everyday.
